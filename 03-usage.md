## Usage

Here is an example of what a coding session using Git might look like if you're creating a new feature for your project, working on it for a few hours and then merging it back in:

```Bash
# Initialize a new Git repository for the project
$ git init

# Create a new branch called "new-feature"
$ git branch new-feature

# Switch to the "new-feature" branch
$ git checkout new-feature

# Make some changes to the code, stage the changes, and save them to the repository
$ [edit files]
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Implemented new feature X"

# Continue working on the new feature, making more changes and committing them to the repository
$ [edit files]
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Fixed bug in new feature X"

# Push the changes to the remote repository
$ git push

# Switch back to the main branch
$ git checkout master

# Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
$ git pull

# Merge the changes from the "new-feature" branch into the main branch
$ git merge new-feature
```
