## Crucial features of GIT

- Repositories: A Git repository is a collection of files and the changes made to them over time.
- Branches: Git allows you to create multiple branches of a repository, which can be used to experiment with new changes or features without affecting the main codebase.
- Staging and committing: Git uses a staging area to manage which changes are ready to be saved to the repository.
- Pushing and pulling: Git allows you to push your local changes to a remote repository, and to pull changes from a remote repository to your local copy.
- Reverting and comparing: Git allows you to revert files back to previous versions, and to compare different versions of a file to see the changes that were made.


## Basic GIT commands (for those features)

#### Repositories:
- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone`: Clones an existing Git repository from a remote source and creates a new local copy.
#### Branches:
- `git branch`: Lists, creates, or deletes branches in the local repository.
- `git checkout`: Switches to a different branch in the local repository.
- `git merge`: Merges changes from one branch into another branch in the local repository.
#### Staging and committing:
- `git add`: Adds one or more files to the staging area, where they can be committed to the repository.
- `git commit`: Saves the changes in the staging area to the local repository, with a message describing the changes.
#### Pushing and pulling:
- `git push`: Pushes the changes from the local repository to a remote Git repository.
- `git pull`: Pulls the latest changes from a remote Git repository and merges them with the local repository.
#### Reverting and comparing:
- `git revert`: Reverts a file or commit, undoing the changes and creating a new commit with the changes.
- `git diff`: Compares two versions of a file and shows the differences between them.
